# CryptoTrader
A bot that trades cryptocurrencies to make a profit. Written in Python.

CryptoTrader uses the ShapeShift API (found here: https://info.shapeshift.io/api). ShapeShift does not support fiat currency, so as of now you will have to provide the bot with your own cryptocurrency. In the future we may add support to buy crypto from somewhere like Coinbase.

Python Libraries Needed: requests
